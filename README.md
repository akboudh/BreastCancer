<h1>Breast Cancer Diagnosis Prediction</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project aims to predict breast cancer diagnosis using logistic regression, decision trees, and shallow neural networks. The dataset used is the "Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. 

Files used:
1. main.py - Python script containing the implementation of the prediction models.
2. BreastCancerDataset.csv - CSV file containing the dataset.
3. README.md - This file containing information about the project, its methods, and sources.
4. requirements.txt - Text file listing the required Python libraries and their versions.

<h2>Methods</h2>

The project employs the following methods:
1. Logistic Regression: A linear classification procedure mapping input features to class probabilities.
2. Decision Trees: A non-parametric algorithm creating a tree-like model based on input features.
3. Shallow Neural Network: An artificial neural network with one hidden layer used for classification.

<h2>Experimental Results</h2>

The dataset was split into training and testing sets in a 75:25 ratio. The performance of the methods was evaluated on the testing set with the following accuracies:
1. Logistic Regression: 95.8%
2. Decision Trees: 94.4%
3. Shallow Neural Network: 95.8%

<h3>Discussion of Results</h3>

The experiment indicates that logistic regression and shallow neural networks performed the best with an accuracy of 95.8%, followed by decision trees with an accuracy of 94.4%. Logistic regression provides a simplified model, while shallow neural networks can capture intricate correlations between input and output variables.
